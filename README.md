## Hey, I'm Jonathan ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently the founding engineer at [Loophole Labs](https://loopholelabs.io/) where we just raised funding from [AmplifyVC](https://amplifypartners.com/) and [Haystack](https://haystack.vc/)!

I've previously worked at [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/), [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/), [Square](https://squareup.com/), [North](https://www.bynorth.com/) (acquired by Google) and [Videostream](https://getvideostream.com/) while in school at UWaterloo.

In my personal life, I really enjoy working out, traveling, photography and cooking!
