## Hey, I'm Jonathan ðŸ‘‹

At the moment, I'm working as a security engineer at [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/)!

I'm also the founding engineer at [Loophole Labs](https://loopholelabs.io/) where we raised a couple mill in funding from [AmplifyVC](https://amplifypartners.com/), [Haystack](https://haystack.vc/), [Bain Capital](https://www.baincapital.com/) & [Google Ventures](https://www.gradient.com/)!

I've previously worked at [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/), [Square](https://squareup.com/), [North](https://www.bynorth.com/) (acquired by Google) and [Videostream](https://getvideostream.com/) while in school at UWaterloo.

In my personal life, I really enjoy fitness bootcamps, lifting, traveling, photography and cooking!
